## Error Responses

All errors follow the standard `ApiError` format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Descriptive error message",
  "code": "ITEM_NOT_FOUND"  // optional error code for client handling
}
```

Common status codes:
- `200` — Success
- `400` — Bad request (validation error)
- `401` — Unauthorized (missing or invalid JWT)
- `403` — Forbidden (insufficient role)
- `404` — Resource not found
- `409` — Conflict (e.g. attempting to move scrapped item)
- `500` — Server error

---

## Implementation Notes

- **Type discrimination:** Items endpoint accepts `itemType` field in request body to create the correct item subtype
- **Soft deletes:** Deleted users/items return `isActive: false` or `status: SCRAPPED`; frontend filters out soft-deleted items by default
- **Pagination:** All list endpoints support page/pageSize params; returns `PaginatedData<T>` wrapper
- **Role filtering:** Query-level enforcement via Prisma middleware; users only see items/operations at their assigned site (unless Admin)
- **Timestamp:** All operations record `performedAt` timestamp and `performedById` (user attribution)

---

## Design Decisions

- **Single items endpoint:** Creates any item type via a single `POST /items` with `itemType` discriminator field (cleaner than separate `/items/electronics`, `/items/fixture` routes)
- **Audit log immutability:** OperationRecord table is append-only; no updates or deletes on operations
- **Soft-delete strategy:** Items/users marked with status/isActive flags; never hard-deleted for full history preservation
- **Role claims in JWT:** Role embedded directly in JWT to avoid per-request role lookups; role changes require token refresh
- **Site-level filtering:** Multi-site support via query middleware; non-admin users filtered to their siteId; admin users see all sites

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Bulk receipt endpoint for receiving multiple items in single request
- [ ] WebSocket or polling for real-time alerts (overdue returns, expiring consumables)
- [ ] File upload endpoint for fixture pictures (multipart/form-data)
- [ ] Barcode/QR code generation endpoints (return PNG/PDF for label printing)
- [ ] Label printer driver integration (Zebra ZPL, Citizen, Brother protocols)
- [ ] Batch operations endpoint (move multiple items at once)
